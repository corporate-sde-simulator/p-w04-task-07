**Status:** Accepted
**Authors:** Vikram Patel, Suresh

## Decision

Implement Consensus log replication module using industry-standard patterns appropriate for golang and our platform requirements.

## Context

This component is part of our platform infrastructure. It needs to handle production traffic, be maintainable, and follow our coding standards.

## Rationale

- Follows established patterns used by industry leaders
- Balances complexity with maintainability
- Appropriate for our current scale and growth projections
- Well-tested approach with known trade-offs

## Consequences

- Must handle edge cases including empty inputs, concurrent access, and error states
- Performance must be monitored after deployment
- Integration tests needed before production rollout
